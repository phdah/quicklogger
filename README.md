# QuickLogger

I often find myself hearing or reading about some tool or concept that I instantly know I _need_ to know more about. Then I typically write the `url` or `name` to the thing, to myself on _Slack_, but often loose context once I get to looking it up. That's why I _need_ the `QuickLogger`, which easily and sufficiently summarizes concepts and tools into a log `automatically` for me, which I can later filter and consume.

## Requires

- Locally running [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) with the model [`mistral`](https://ollama.ai/library/mistral)
- [curl](https://curl.se/) CLI

## What is QuickLogger?

This project presents a powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool built in C++, designed to summarize text and extract key concepts from either direct text input or content retrieved from web links. Utilizing an open source and locally running [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) LLM, this tool efficiently and asynchronously processes input text to provide concise summaries and identify core concepts, enhancing readability and comprehension. Additionally, when provided with a URL, it skillfully scrapes the corresponding website to summarize the content found within, alongside any text input provided by the user.

The QuickLogger supports multiple build in pickers, and easily added customized pickers of your own. See here how to add: **\<future link\>**

### Supported pickers

| Picker | Status | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOG` | âœ… | Write out a log entry line to a specified `text` file, following this format: `{currentDatetime} : {prompt} : {llmResult}` |
| `TODO` | âœ… | Write out a checkbox in `markdown` format into a specified file, following this format: `* [ ] {llmResult}` |


## Roadmap

* [x] POC the initial CLI using Python for fast development
* [ ] Rewrite module(s) in `c++`
* [ ] POC a fronted for the output, e.g., `TODO`'s and `LOG`'s
* [ ] Define a fronted, reachable without the terminal, to interact with the QuickLogger CLI, to add entries with proper pickers
